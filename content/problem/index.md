## The Realities of College Tennis Scheduling

Creating a college tennis schedule is far more complex than simply filling in dates. Coaches must carefully consider a wide range of factors, including:

- **Opponent rankings** and how wins/losses affect ITA points  
- **Climate and altitude**, which can impact player performance  
- **Surface type** — indoor vs outdoor  
- **Matchup strategy**, such as aligning experienced players against freshmen  
- **Travel logistics and cost**, especially for long-distance trips  
- **Conference vs non-conference constraints**, which vary by school

## Conference Constraints & Competitive Imbalance

Recent changes in NCAA tennis scheduling make things even harder:

- **Power 4 conferences** (e.g., SEC, ACC, Pac-12) often begin conference play as early as February, leaving fewer opportunities for mid-major programs (like Santa Clara) to schedule high-quality non-conference matches.
  
- In some conferences, like the **WCC**, teams are not allowed to travel with partners to reduce costs — creating further logistical complications.

These issues create a ripple effect:  
Mid-major schools struggle to get ranked matchups. Power 4 schools protect their rankings. Ultimately, most mid-major schools are not going to beat teams ranked 1 - 30 but from 31 - 50 the level of teams are a pretty similar level. Being able to have more chances at increasing your ranking could also assist in recruiting as top junior players want to join programs that are competitive.

This is the exact type of problem that linear optimization was built to solve.
