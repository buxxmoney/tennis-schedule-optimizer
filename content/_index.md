title: "Optimize College Tennis Schedules with Data"
description: "Smarter match scheduling using linear optimization and ITA ranking logic."
---

College tennis coaches face growing challenges when building match schedules:

- ❌ Power 4 schools are locking into conference play earlier  
- 💸 Rising travel costs and limited windows reduce flexibility  
- 📊 ITA ranking rules pressure coaches to avoid risky matchups

🎾 I built a solution using **linear optimization** to help coaches:

- Maximize ranked home matches
- Stay within travel and climate constraints
- Get fair matchups based on ranking tiers
